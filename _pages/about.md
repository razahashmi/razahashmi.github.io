<p>This is my website, where I will share the things i have done, my upcoming research projects, write about papers I've read recently and will also host code for my published papers. </p>
<p>Currently working on the following ideas:<br> Improving machine learning models, Uncertainity estimation in neural networks, multi-agent learning and mathematical understanding of deep learning.</p>
Looking for peers to work with on the above mentioned topics. 
Feel free to reach out to me to discuss my ongoing projects.

<!--- This site similar to my life is under-construction and eventual progress will be made. 
Thank you for bearing with this. --->

<h1> Work </h1>
ðŸŒŸ Early Product: Ofono App (2016â€“2017)
For nearly a decade, I was deeply involved in building innovative, user-centric products. My journey began with a mobile app that aimed to capture emotions through emojis, a slider to indicate intensity, and a text input for context. We integrated a social layer to allow users to share how they were feeling with their network.

Our vision evolved into a marketing intelligence tool where brands could:

Track sentiment around product launches.

View long-term trends in brand perception.

Get real-time emotional feedback.

For consumers, it offered a quick and delightful way to express emotions. We also envisioned positive social impact, enabling users to uplift others and offer support.

Despite our best efforts, the product didnâ€™t achieve market fit. Still, it was an incredibly formative experienceâ€”teaching me how to balance user needs, technical feasibility, and product direction under real-world conditions.

ðŸ”· *[SHAPE](https://shapepowered.com/)* â€“ HR Intelligence Platform (2017â€“Present)

SHAPE began as an advanced survey tool, asking deep questions on:

* Workplace culture

* Manager-employee relationships

* Peer dynamics

* Business essentials and work environment


SHAPE rapidly evolved into a comprehensive HR intelligence platform. Its key capabilities include:
*   **Organizational Hierarchy Mapping:** Visualizing complex company structures.
*   **Role-Based Access & Reporting:** Tailored dashboards and insights for employees, managers, and executives.
*   **Complex Structure Management:** Supporting multi-layered national and international organizations (e.g., Toyota Pakistan â†’ Regional â†’ Toyota Japan) while maintaining precise reporting lines and data aggregation.

I played a pivotal role across the entire product lifecycle, contributing to technical development, UX/UI design, and strategic product direction.

ðŸ§  **My Key Contributions to SHAPE:**

**Privacy-Centric Algorithms:** Developed novel mathematical approaches to ensure employee anonymity in survey data.
ðŸ‘‰ *[Privacy Demo](https://razahashmi.github.io/files/privacy_demo.html#intro)*. 

**State of the art scoring algorith:** Designed and implemented proprietary scoring systems for nuanced survey analysis.

**Dynamic Onboarding & Org Mapping:** Created intuitive user flows for employees to define team structures, reporting lines, and map organizational hierarchies.

**Comprehensive Admin Panel:** Built robust administrative tools for managing company metadata, survey configurations, user accounts, and system settings.

 **Multi-Level Reporting Architecture:** Engineered systems for identity inheritance and aggregated/disaggregated reporting across complex conglomerate structures.
