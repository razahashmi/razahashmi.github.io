<p>This is my website, where I will share the things i have done, my upcoming research projects, write about papers I've read recently and will also host code for my published papers. </p>
<p>Currently working on the following ideas:<br> Improving machine learning models, Uncertainity estimation in neural networks, multi-agent learning and mathematical understanding of deep learning.</p>
Looking for peers to work with on the above mentioned topics. 
Feel free to reach out to me to discuss my ongoing projects.

<!--- This site similar to my life is under-construction and eventual progress will be made. 
Thank you for bearing with this. --->
