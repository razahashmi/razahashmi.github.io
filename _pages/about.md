I’m a **product builder** who also does **machine learning research**.
Over the last decade I’ve taken products from fuzzy problem statements to shipped systems—connecting user needs, UX, data/metrics, and implementation to build solutions that are **privacy-conscious, decision-useful, and scalable**.

On the research side, I work on **uncertainty**, **interpretability**, and the **learning dynamics** that shape model behavior.

## Now

- Drafting papers (in progress; not yet submitted):
- **Pathway-Enhanced Uncertainty Estimation** — uncertainty from internal pathway/prototype consistency
- **Diffusion-based Uncertainty** — sampling-driven uncertainty with theory checks and baseline comparisons
- **Difficulty Is Relative** — a unified suite to measure and predict class-pair difficulty
- Building evaluation tooling for distribution shift, calibration, and rejection/coverage tradeoffs


## What I’m known for

- Turning messy, ambiguous problems into clear product strategy, experiments, and shipped outcomes
- Designing incentive-aligned systems (metrics, scoring, dashboards) that people actually trust and use
- Building privacy-preserving approaches that don’t compromise analytical usefulness
- Partnering effectively across engineering, design, and stakeholders with crisp communication

## Highlights

### Product leadership (SHAPE — Survey & HR Intelligence Platform)

As Head of Product, I helped evolve [SHAPE](https://shapepowered.com/) from an advanced survey product into an HR intelligence platform with:

- Org hierarchy mapping for complex, multi-layered organizations
- Role-based access and reporting for employees, managers, and executives
- Multi-level reporting architecture (aggregation/disaggregation across org structures)
- Proprietary scoring approaches for nuanced survey analytics

Selected scale / proof points:

- 12 measurement dimensions (“Explorers”) across **You / Team / Org**
- Validated across **thousands of employees**, industries, and regions
- Instant personal report with **60+ report cards** per employee

Selected artifacts:

- [Privacy-centric algorithms demo:](/files/privacy_demo.html#intro)
- [Scoring system Whitepaper:](/files/SPS.html)

### Building measurement frameworks (World Flourishing Organization)

As a founding member at [World Flourishing Organization](https://worldflourishing.org/), I helped develop a framework to identify and measure flourishing in organizations—bridging research concepts, practical measurement, and what it would take to run this at scale.

### ML Research

- Presented: [“Explainable AI: Object Recognition With Help From Background” (ICLR 2022, CSS Workshop):](/publications/2022-04-29-object-recognition-with-backgrounds)
- Current work (drafts): pathway-based uncertainty, diffusion-based uncertainty, and difficulty/learning-dynamics methods (see “Now” above).

## Interests

- Tech startups building creative solutions to real problems
- Products where measurement, incentives, and decision-making under uncertainty matter
- AI-enabled products where model behavior, evaluation, and deployment tradeoffs matter
- Research collaborations in uncertainty, generalization, and interpretability

## Writing & side projects
