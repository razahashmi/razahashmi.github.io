<p>This is my website, where I will share the things i have done, my upcoming research projects, write about papers I've read recently and will also host code for my published papers. </p>
<p>Currently working on the following ideas:<br> Improving machine learning models, Uncertainity estimation in neural networks, multi-agent learning and mathematical understanding of deep learning.</p>
Looking for admissions into a PhD programme and in search for professors/peers to work with.

<!--- This site similar to my life is under-construction and eventual progress will be made. 
Thank you for bearing with this. --->
