<p>This is my website, where I will share the things i have done, my upcoming research projects, write about papers I've read recently and will also host code for my published papers. </p>
<p>Currently working on the following ideas:<br> Improving machine learning models, Uncertainity estimation in neural networks, multi-agent learning and mathematical understanding of deep learning.</p>
Looking for peers to work with on the above mentioned topics. 
Feel free to reach out to me to discuss my ongoing projects.

<!--- This site similar to my life is under-construction and eventual progress will be made. 
Thank you for bearing with this. --->

<h1> Work </h1>
ðŸŒŸ Early Product: Ofono App (2016â€“2017)
For nearly a decade, I was deeply involved in building innovative, user-centric products. My journey began with a mobile app that aimed to capture emotions through emojis, a slider to indicate intensity, and a text input for context. We integrated a social layer to allow users to share how they were feeling with their network.

Our vision evolved into a marketing intelligence tool where brands could:

Track sentiment around product launches.

View long-term trends in brand perception.

Get real-time emotional feedback.

For consumers, it offered a quick and delightful way to express emotions. We also envisioned positive social impact, enabling users to uplift others and offer support.

Despite our best efforts, the product didnâ€™t achieve market fit. Still, it was an incredibly formative experienceâ€”teaching me how to balance user needs, technical feasibility, and product direction under real-world conditions.

ðŸ”· *[SHAPE](https://shapepowered.com/)* â€“ HR Intelligence Platform (2017â€“Present)

SHAPE began as a modern culture and engagement survey tool, asking deep questions on:

Workplace culture

Manager-employee relationships

Peer dynamics

It later evolved into a comprehensive HR platform that:

Mapped organizational hierarchies

Supported multiple user roles (employees, managers, executives)

Generated customized reports per role

Supported complex org structures (e.g., Toyota Pakistan â†’ Regional â†’ Toyota Japan), while preserving reporting lines across layers

I contributed across the stackâ€”from technical development to UX/UI design, and deeply into product strategy.

ðŸ§  My Key Contributions:

Privacy-first algorithms for protecting employee identity.

Custom scoring methodologies for surveys.

Dynamic onboarding flows to map teams, managers, and org structure.

Admin panels for managing: Company metadata, Survey configuration, User management

Designed systems for multi-level reporting and identity inheritance for conglomerate clients.

This demo highlights the key insights i used to protect the privacy of participants in the survey.
