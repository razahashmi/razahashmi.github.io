It all started with a simple walk to class. Back at university, there were two distinct pathways to the lecture hall. Both were the exact same distance, had the same view, and took the same amount of time. Yet, I noticed something strange: people rarely picked a path at random. One route always seemed to pull more people than the other.

I used to spend my walks wondering why. Was it a subconscious "nudge" from a friend leading the group? Did the introverts instinctively peel off to the quieter path to avoid the crowd? It became clear that the decision wasn't about the geometry of the road—it was about the psychology of the walker.

That curiosity followed me after graduation into my work at a survey company. I saw those same invisible forces at play, observing how personality traits and context could subtly shift how people answered questions. Traditional research only captures what people *say* or *post*—but what about everyone else? The ones who read, consider, and choose *not* to engage?

So I built a sandbox to simulate the complete picture: **300 AI personas**, each with distinct personalities, ideologies, and interests, exposed to **3,000 real tweets**. Every persona processes content through a stochastic cognitive pipeline—evaluating relevance, tracking emotional state, and deciding whether to engage. The result? **3,317 engagement events** with realistic power-law distributions, social cascades through small-world networks, and traceable decision paths showing exactly why each persona did or didn't respond.

This isn't just a simulation—it's a research instrument. You can trace precisely which cognitive gates filtered out each persona, what would need to change to tip the outcome, and how different personality types respond to identical content. The full technical breakdown, visualizations, and system architecture are all documented below.
