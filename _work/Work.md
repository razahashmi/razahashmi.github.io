ðŸŒŸ Early Product: Ofono App (2016â€“2017)
For nearly a decade, I was deeply involved in building innovative, user-centric products. My journey began with a mobile app that aimed to capture emotions through emojis, a slider to indicate intensity, and a text input for context. We integrated a social layer to allow users to share how they were feeling with their network.

Our vision evolved into a marketing intelligence tool where brands could:

Track sentiment around product launches.

View long-term trends in brand perception.

Get real-time emotional feedback.

For consumers, it offered a quick and delightful way to express emotions. We also envisioned positive social impact, enabling users to uplift others and offer support.

Despite our best efforts, the product didnâ€™t achieve market fit. Still, it was an incredibly formative experienceâ€”teaching me how to balance user needs, technical feasibility, and product direction under real-world conditions.

SHAPE began as an advanced survey tool, asking deep questions on:

SHAPE rapidly evolved into a comprehensive HR intelligence platform. Its key capabilities include:
*   **Organizational Hierarchy Mapping:** Visualizing complex company structures.

*   **Complex Structure Management:** Supporting multi-layered national and international organizations (e.g., Toyota Pakistan â†’ Regional â†’ Toyota Japan) while maintaining precise reporting lines and data aggregation.

I played a pivotal role across the entire product lifecycle, contributing to technical development, UX/UI design, and strategic product direction.
