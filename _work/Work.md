For nearly a decade, I was deeply involved in building innovative, user-centric products.

ðŸ”· **Chief Product Officer - *[SHAPE](https://shapepowered.com/)* â€“ Survey & HR Intelligence Platform (2018â€“Present)**

SHAPE began as an advanced survey tool, exploring key dimensions such as physical and psychological health, life outside work, corporate culture, engagement, commitment, job satisfaction, coworker dynamics, management style, business essentials, and both physical and soft work environments.

It soon evolved into a comprehensive HR intelligence platform. Its key capabilities include:
*   **Organizational Hierarchy Mapping:** Visualizing complex company structures.
*   **Role-Based Access & Reporting:** Tailored dashboards and insights for employees, managers, and executives.
*   **Complex Structure Management:** Supporting multi-layered national and international organizations (e.g., Toyota Pakistan â†’ Regional â†’ Toyota Japan) while maintaining precise reporting lines and data aggregation.

I played a pivotal role across the entire product lifecycle, contributing to technical development, UX/UI design, and strategic product direction.

ðŸ§  **My Key Contributions to SHAPE:**

**Privacy-Centric Algorithms:** Developed novel mathematical approaches to ensure employee anonymity in survey data.

**Dynamic Onboarding & Org Mapping:** Created intuitive user flows for employees to define team structures, reporting lines, and map organizational hierarchies.

**Comprehensive Admin Panel:** Built robust administrative tools for managing company metadata, survey configurations, user accounts, and system settings.

 **Multi-Level Reporting Architecture:** Engineered systems for identity inheritance and aggregated/disaggregated reporting across complex conglomerate structures.


**Founding Member â€“ World Flourishing Organization ([WFO](https://worldflourishing.org/)) (2024â€“Present)**

WFO recognizes and celebrates the worldâ€™s most flourishing organizationsâ€”those that lead with purpose, measure what matters, and turn insight into impact. We are setting a new global standard: human flourishing as the driver of business excellence.

As a founding member, I led the development of an innovative framework to identify and measure flourishing within organizations. This state-of-the-art system challenges traditional metrics, leveraging technology and AI to redefine how organizational success is recognized in the modern era.

ðŸŒŸ **Analyst - Ofono App (2016â€“2018)**
My journey began with a mobile app that aimed to capture emotions through emojis, a slider to indicate intensity, and a text input for context. We integrated a social layer to allow users to share how they were feeling with their network.

Our vision evolved into a marketing intelligence tool where brands could:
Track sentiment around product launches.
View long-term trends in brand perception.
Get real-time emotional feedback.

For consumers, it offered a quick and delightful way to express emotions. We also envisioned positive social impact, enabling users to uplift others and offer support.

Despite our best efforts, the product didnâ€™t achieve market fit. Still, it was an incredibly formative experienceâ€”teaching me how to balance user needs, technical feasibility, and product direction under real-world conditions.
